## Week 1 — Azure Networking foundations (14-12-25)

Deployed a small VNet + subnet and an Ubuntu VM with SSH via Terraform. Verified private IP, default route, DNS resolver behavior, and outbound connectivity (ping to 8.8.8.8). Learned how Terraform reads local SSH public-key paths and fixed path issues for repeatable runs.
